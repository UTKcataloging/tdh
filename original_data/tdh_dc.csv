Worcester, Christian missionary living in the Cherokee Nation, to Georgia Governor George R. Gilmer in response to a letter Worcester received from Gilmer. Worcester received the letter by Gilmer through Colonel Sanford and is informed by Sanford that he is liable to arrest if he has not removed within ten days. Worcester defends himself against accusations made by the governor, contending that his goal is to stimulate the spiritual growth of the Cherokee people and not to revolt politically against the state. He explains why he cannot in good conscience take the oath of Georgia and describes his progress in translating Christian texts into Cherokee. Worcester is determined to remain with the Cherokee until he is forced to move. Elias Boudinot, editor of the ""Cherokee Phoenix"" newspaper is mentioned."|Cherokee Indians -- Missions|Worcester, S.

Chota, as with all the Overhill Cherokee sites, is now inundated by the Tellico Reservoir. Excavations of Overhill Cherokee villages were conducted by the University of Tennessee between 1967 and 1983 as part of the Tellico Archaeological Project. Excavations continued until 1983, and laboratory studies and report preparation continued until 1987. The excavations were conducted in anticipation of the flooding of the Lower Little Tennessee River Valley, in eastern Tennessee, by the Tellico Dam Reservoir. The excavations were conducted under contract with the National Park Service and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Principal Investigator, Alfred K. Guthe. Field Director, J.

The drawing is based on historical descriptions as well as archaeological excavations conducted by The University of Tennessee from 1969-1974. The excavations were conducted in anticipation of the flooding of the Lower Little Tennessee River by the Tellico Dam Reservoir under contract with the National Park Service and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA).

Fort Marr, also known as 'The Old Fort,' was constructed around 1814 near Old Fort, Tennessee. The fort was positioned along the Old Federal Road and housed troops who were assigned to protect white travelers using the road and the Cherokees from Creek retaliation. The fort was also said to have been used to safeguard supplies and as a campsite for soldiers in transit during the Creek War of 1814-1815. The name Fort Marr was established when the fort was renovated into a stockade to use during the removal of the Cherokee people to the west. It is believed that the fort was named after George Washington Lent Marr, who served under Andrew Jackson during the War of 1812 and the campaign of 1813-1814. After being relocated times since its construction, it was moved to its present location at Benton in 1965. In 1980, Fort Marr became the property of the Conservation Department of the state of Tennessee to be maintained and used as a historic site.|    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/|http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/|http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance|http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd|    |Schroedl, Gerald F.|1980-00-00|    |Text/html|http://idserver.utk.edu/?id=200300000000252|en|The University of Tennessee Libraries|This work in the property of the Frank H.

2009-03-06T21:35:03Z|MM056|tdh|University of Tennessee Special Collections Library, Knoxville|Frank H. McClung Museum (Knoxville, Tenn.)|    |    |    |    |This photograph is of a reconstructed blockhouse at Fort Southwest Point, located near the city of Kingston, in Roane County, Tennessee. There are four reconstructed blockhouses at the fort, with two blockhouses located at the west end of the fort and the other two located at the east end. Fort Southwest Point was established in 1792 as a blockhouse post for the territorial militia troops that were protecting white settlers from Indian acts of hostility. By 1797, the militia was replaced by Federal troops whose goals were to maintain peace with the Indians and protect their rights on the frontier. During the years between 1801-1807, the fort was established as the headquarters for the Cherokee Agency. In 1974, archaeological crews from the University of Tennessee unearthed portions of six fort building foundations, the remains of a massive stone wall, and many fort-period artifacts. A 1984 excavation of the site by the Department of Conservation and the City of Kingston located the sites of a total of thirteen buildings. These buildings include an officer's barracks, four blockhouses, and several buildings that are believed to have been barracks. A complementary excavation in 1986 revealed the location of two more buildings, bringing the total to fifteen buildings.

McClung Museum (Knoxville, Tenn.)|    |    |    |    |Document ID: mm057|This photograph is of a reconstructed barracks at Fort Southwest Point, located near the city of Kingston, in Roane County, Tennessee. The barracks are made with hewn logs and are double penned structures with a fireplace in the middle of the building. The barracks were most likely used to house the enlisted men that occupied the fort. Fort Southwest Point was established in 1792 as a blockhouse post for the territorial militia troops that were protecting white settlers from Indian acts of hostility. By 1797, the militia was replaced by Federal troops whose goals were to maintain peace with the Indians and protect their rights on the frontier. During the years between 1801-1807, the fort was established as the headquarters for the Cherokee Agency. In 1974, archaeological crews from the University of Tennessee unearthed portions of six fort building foundations, the remains of a massive stone wall, and many fort-period artifacts. A 1984 excavation of the site by the Department of Conservation and the City of Kingston located the sites of a total of thirteen buildings. These buildings include an officer's barracks, four blockhouses, and several buildings that are believed to have been barracks. A complementary excavation in 1986 revealed the location of two more buildings, bringing the total to fifteen buildings. The excavation also produced a more detailed examination of the palisade and stone wall enclosures, and uncovered several historic and prehistoric features.

McClung Museum (Knoxville, Tenn.)|    |    |    |    |Document ID: mm059|This photograph is of the Great Spring at the Red Clay site at Red Clay State Park in Bradley County, Tennessee. The Great Spring, also known as the Blue Hole Spring, is a natural spring that not only supplied the Cherokees who met here with potable water, but was also a sacred and spiritual place for them. By 1832, the state of Georgia had refused the Cherokee the right to hold council meetings unless the meeting dealt with treaties that gave away their lands. The Cherokee decided to move their capital from New Echota, Georgia across the state line to Red Clay, Tennessee because the state of Tennessee did not prohibit the Cherokees from meeting together. Thus, Red Clay became the sear of the Cherokee government in 1832 and lasted until the removal of the Cherokees to the west in 1838. Red Clay was composed of 11 general councils and the meetings were attended by up to 5000 people. It was at Red Clay that the Cherokee learned that they had lost all of their land and would be removed to the west. Red Clay consists of the sacred Blue Hole Spring, a reconstructed council house, and several reconstructed homestead buildings. Red Clay is also the home to the Eternal Flame, lit on April 6, 1984. The Cherokees took hot coals from their council fire at Ted Clay on the Trail of Tears. The flame was later taken to Cherokee, North Carolina in the 1950s but was returned to Red Clay in 1984. This was the first symbolic step unifying the Eastern Cherokees with the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma since their removal in 1838. Today Red Clay State Historical Park is not only a historical site, but is also an interpretive site on the Trail of Tears.|    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/|http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/|http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance|http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd|    |Schroedl, Gerald F.|1980-00-00|    |Text/html|http://idserver.utk.edu/?id=200300000000256|en|The University of Tennessee Libraries|This work in the property of the Frank H.

Kaolin pipes are named for the white clay that they are made from. Kaolin pipes were made in England as early as the 17th century. Over time, the shape, size, and patterns changed on the pipes. Chattooga is a Cherokee archaeological site that was formerly called 'Cherokee Town.' Cherokee Town was an 18th century village associated with the Lower town Cherokee communities of northern Georgia and western South Carolina. The site is thought to have been occupied for only 160 years and was abandoned by the Cherokees in the 1740s. This site is given special attention because it retained early 18th century Cherokee material culture. This material culture is difficult to find and distinguish on other Cherokee sites of the same time period. The University of Tennessee (UT) and the Francis Marion National Forest conducted archaeological excavations at Chattooga during 1989-1994. The focus of these excavations was to develop a better understanding of the nature of the historical Cherokee occupation at the site and compare these findings with those found on other 18th century Cherokee sites. As a result of these excavations, archaeologists were able to identify and partially excavate the remains of five superimposed council houses. In addition, the excavations of two winter structures and one summer domestic structure were conducted. Through the use of surface collection, test pit excavations, and remote sensing equipment, vast amounts of artifacts and the location of additional buildings and features were found with minimal disturbance to the site.

Chattooga is a Cherokee archaeological site that was formerly called 'Cherokee Town.' Cherokee Town was an 18th century village associated with the Lower town Cherokee communities of northern Georgia and western South Carolina. The site is thought to have been occupied for only 160 years and was abandoned by the Cherokees in the 1740s. This site is given special attention because it retained early 18th century Cherokee material culture. This material culture is difficult to find and distinguish on other Cherokee sites of the same time period. The University of Tennessee (UT) and the Francis Marion National Forest conducted archaeological excavations at Chattooga during 1989-1994. The focus of these excavations was to develop a better understanding of the nature of the historical Cherokee occupation at the site and compare these findings with those found on other 18th century Cherokee sites. As a result of these excavations, archaeologists were able to identify and partially excavate the remains of five superimposed council houses. In addition, the excavations of two winter structures and one summer domestic structure were conducted. Through the use of surface collection, test pit excavations, and remote sensing equipment, vast amounts of artifacts and the location of additional buildings and features were found with minimal disturbance to the site.

There are four reconstructed blockhouses at the fort, with two blockhouses located at the west end of the fort and the other two located at the east end. Fort Southwest Point was established in 1792 as a blockhouse post for the territorial militia troops that were protecting white settlers from Indian acts of hostility. By 1797, the militia was replaced by Federal troops whose goals were to maintain peace with the Indians and protect their rights on the frontier. During the years between 1801-1807, the fort was established as the headquarters for the Cherokee Agency. In 1974, archaeological crews from the University of Tennessee unearthed portions of six fort building foundations, the remains of a massive stone wall, and many fort-period artifacts. A 1984 excavation of the site by the Department of Conservation and the City of Kingston located the sites of a total of thirteen buildings. These buildings include an officer's barracks, four blockhouses, and several buildings that are believed to have been barracks. A complementary excavation in 1986 revealed the location of two more buildings, bringing the total to fifteen buildings. The excavation also produced a ore detailed examination of the palisade and stone wall enclosures, and uncovered several historic and prehistoric features. Additional excavations were conducted at Fort Southwest Point in the 1990s yielded new information as to the fort's original layout and functions, as well as the life ways of the people who occupied the fort.

A complementary excavation in 1986 revealed the location of two more buildings, bringing the total to fifteen buildings. The excavation also produced a more detailed examination of the palisade and stone wall enclosures, and uncovered several historic and prehistoric features. Additional excavations were conducted at Fort Southwest Point in the 1900s yielded new information as to the fort's original layout and functions, as well as the life ways of the people who occupied the fort. Fort Southwest Point was given to the city of Kingston by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and is now used as a historical and recreational area.|    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/|http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/|http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance|http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd|    |Schroedl, Gerald F.|1980-00-00|    |Text/html|http://idserver.utk.edu/?id=200300000000274|en|The University of Tennessee Libraries|This work in the property of the Frank H.

The focus of these excavations was to develop a better understanding of the nature of the historical Cherokee occupation at the site and compare these findings with those found on other 18th century Cherokee sites. As a result of these excavations, archaeologists were able to identify and partially excavate the remains of five superimposed council houses. In addition, the excavations of two winter structures and one summer domestic structure were conducted. Through the use of surface collection, test pit excavations, and remote sensing equipment, vast amounts of artifacts and the location of additional buildings and features were found with minimal disturbance to the site.

The letter tells that the town of Tooquachee (Toocabatchee) in the Creek Nation, where four different tribes of Indians once held friendly conferences, has been taken from Creek chief Big Warrior and destroyed. While Big Warrior is considered a ""friendly"" Creek, the letter states that the majority of Creek Nation has gone against him to join the rebel party. The Cherokees indicate that they have information that one of the prophets partly responsible for the uprising has escaped to the Choctaw Nation. Included is a warning from Big Warrior to the Cherokees to arm themselves against the rebellious Creeks along their borders."|Cherokee Indians -- Warfare|Southern States|Tookabatchee (Ga.)|Creek War, 1813-1814|Cherokee Indians|    |    |    |    |    |http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/|http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/|http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance|http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd|University of Tennessee Special Collections Library, Knoxville|Kanchestaneskee|1813-07-23|    |Text/html|http://idserver.utk.edu/?id=200400000002190|en|University of Tennessee Special Collections Library|This work is the property of the Special Collections Library, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN.

The Farewell Address was given on March 4, 1837, as Jackson prepared to retire from the presidency and from public life in general. In the address, he discusses his presidency's contributions to the nation, as well as his opposition to the national bank and nullification. The Proclamation to South Carolina was written on December 10, 1832, in response to an earlier decision of the state legislature of South Carolina to nullify a recent tariff bill passed by the federal government. Jackson severely chastises the insistence that states are sovereign and have the right to nullify federal laws, and he accuses South Carolina of trying to disrupt the Union and transgressing the Constitution.|United States|United States Politics and government 1815-1861|    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/|http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/|http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance|http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd|    |Jackson, Andrew|1850-00-00|    |Text/html|http://idserver.utk.edu/?id=200300000000404|en|University of Tennessee Special Collections Library|This work is the property of the Tennessee State Library and Archives, Nashville, TN.

P. Blair on July 28, 1840. In the letter, Jackson defends Blair and General Jessup against allegations made by General Scott. General Scott alleged that Blair and General Jessup recalled him from military duty in Florida, when in fact it was Jackson. General Scott had been ordered to Florida to look for Indian warriors and to prevent a war with the Creeks. Instead of following orders to go directly to Florida, taking eight days worth of supplies on the soldiers' backs, Scott took three weeks waiting for wagons to take the supplies to Florida. Several of the soldiers were killed in an attack while waiting for the wagons, and Scott became ill. General Jessup was sent to fight the now explosive war with the Creeks and Scott went to where Jessup's soldiers were and attempted to take command of them. Because of this action, as well as not arming his troops for six weeks on the frontier, Jackson recalled General Scott from his command duties. Jackson also mentions political events in the letter, such as the pass of the Independent Treasury bill and the next Presidential election.|Southern States|Military supplies|United States -- Politics and government -- 1809-1817|Creek War, 1813-1814|    |    |    |    |    |    |http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/|http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/|http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance|http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd|    |Jackson, Andrew|1840-07-28|    |Text/html|http://idserver.utk.edu/?id=200300000000411|en|University of Tennessee Special Collections Library|This work is the property of the Tennessee State Library and Archives, Nashville, TN.

The navy at this time is strong, while the army's land battles have not been very successful. In fighting the British, many American soldiers have been taken as prisoners in Canada. Sevier worries that with the southern soldiers joining the northern troops near the Canadian border, that the Cherokee and whites remaining in the south will be at war over land and rights. Sevier states that Congress has reported using $21 million in expenditures and proposes a further $20 million be used for merchant bonds. Congress also rejected a bill requiring a 25 cent per gallon tax on the sale of whiskey.

She complains that her family would not let her write to Jane because they were worried Jane would not want to pay the postage. She writes that the family has been concerned for her and that their mother wants to know what kind of medicine she is taking. Sarah updates Jane on the news from the neighborhood, sicknesses, marriages, etc. The sisters are trying to decide between a barbecue or a speech on temperance as their July 4th activities. Margaret has greatly enjoyed the book The Three Eras of a Woman's Life. They did not like Mrs. Cary's book because she thinks that all women should be punished for what Eve may have done, and the sisters do not agree. Sarah wants to be sure that Jane will send her a copy of her piece on Presentiment and her anecdote.|Temperance and religious|Religious thought -- 19th century|Tennessee|Letters|    |    |    |    |    |    |http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/|http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/|http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance|http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd|    |Bell, Sarah|1837-06-27|    |Text/html|http://idserver.utk.edu/?id=200300000000517|en|University of Tennessee Special Collections Library|This work is the property of the Tennessee State Library and Archives, Nashville, TN.

He travels down the Holston, French Broad, Clinch, Tennessee, and Cumberland Rivers. The trip starts on December 22, 1779 and is completed on April 24, 1780. Donelson's boat is joined early in the voyage by several others going along the same route. Donelson writes about an accident they have on the French Broad river in February. One of the other vessels sinks. A slave dies on the Clinch river in March from severe frost bite. Later that month the travellers have trouble with the Chickamaugas, who have villages down the south side of the Tennessee River. Captain Blackemore's boat, which had been quarantined from the others due to small pox, is attacked by these natives, and many people are killed or captured. Donelson writes about the flotilla trying to navigate the Whirl, a particularly dangerous place on the Tennessee River near Chattanooga. There, they are attacked again by the Chickamaugas. One family named Jennings is left behind when their boat becomes trapped in the Whirl, but they are able to eventually catch up to the others. Donelson writes about trouble they have going through the Muscle Shoals in mid-March. On the Cumberland River they begin to have food shortages and are forced to hunt buffalo to survive.

Gaines is in charge of protecting the Western Frontier of the United States from attack by Mexicans and Native Americans, who are fighting the Texans. Gaines' request for more gunmen has been refused by President Jackson. Gaines writes an apology to Cannon for any embarrassment this occurrence may have caused him, though Gaines still thinks he is right about needing the extra men to repel a major assault from the Natives, which he feels will be inevitable when the Mexican army crosses the Brazos River in western Texas. Gaines is very concerned about not being able to protect the settlers in the Disputed Territory from a massacre, since something similar happened in East Florida. Gaines also complains that the people in the interior, who are influential and educated, do not care about the welfare of the frontier families.|Indians of North America -- Wars|Mexico - Foreign Relations -- 1821-1861|Gaines, Edmond Pendleton, 1777-1849 Correspondence.|Frontier Patrols|Sabine River|    |    |    |    |    |http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/|http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/|http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance|http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd|    |Gaines, Edmond P.|1836-08-28|    |Text/html|http://idserver.utk.edu/?id=200300000001082|en|University of Tennessee Special Collections Library|This work is the property of the Tennessee State Library and Archives, Nashville, TN.

Gaines offers recommendations for building and staffing forts, and mentions the need for rail roads west of the Mississippi River.

How The Judgement of Heaven fell on the Indians who wounded Rev'd Joseph Brown in 1794,"" was written to Colonel A. W. Putman on March 30, 1858 by Reverend Joseph Brown. In this narrative Brown details the events surrounding his return trip from Knoxville to Nashville. It appears that he was informed by a Cherokee trader that there was a large body of Indians waiting to do harm on the direct route, so he was advised to return through Kentucky. Accepting this advice, Brown and travel partners, William Hayes, a Negro woman, Ross, Friley, and others set out only to be ambushed along the way by Indians. During the attack Brown was wounded in the shoulder although they escaped. He stayed with a Dutch man for two nights and then with a brother-in-law, who was a doctor, of Ross's for six weeks, until he healed well enough to travel home. Later, Brown was informed by another trader that the same party of Indians had rode into East Tennessee to take prisoners of women and children and if Brown and others wanted to free the prisoners he would show them where they were. Brown set out with a group of white men to seek revenge on the Indians. When they located them they noticed that the Indians were wearing white men's clothing and, satisfied that these were the guilty Indians, they decided to lay in wait to ambush them in the morning fearing that the prisoners would be killed if they acted too quickly. The Indians were all killed the next day and the white men found a little girl who had hid for three days. Brown submitted this account with the intent that it would be published or returned. It was, in fact, published in the ""Banner of Peace"" August 5, 1858."|Tennessee|Brigands and robbers|Cherokee Indians|Prisoners|Indians of North America -- Claims against|Writings|    |    |    |    |http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/|http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/|http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance|http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd|    |Brown, Joseph|1858-03-30|    |Text/html|http://idserver.utk.edu/?id=200300000000724|en|The University of Tennessee Libraries|This work is the property of the Tennessee State Library and Archives, Nashville, Tennessee.

Piomingo wrote this letter as a plea to the United States government for assistance. Hostility existed between the Chickasaws and the Creeks, and the letter described an attack by the Creek on the Chickasaw Nation. Although the Chickasaw were able to hold off and defeat the Creek, they endured considerable losses. Piomingo urged Robertson to think of Chickasaws as the brothers of Americans and that brothers should want to help each other in times of need.

The first is a letter written by Colonel James Robertson to Creek chief Alexander McGillivray on August 3, 1788. In that letter, Robertson discussed episodes of violence between the Creeks and/or Cherokees and American settlers and troops. Robertson also offered McGillivray a gun and some land in the Cumberland region. The second part of the document is a detailed explanation of Robertson's letter written by A.W. Putnam in 1859. Putnam provided an analysis of the historical context of the letter as well as his own opinions of the situations at hand at the time the letter was written. Putnam described the hostilities that existed between the Creeks and the American frontier settlers. He painted a portrait of the Creeks and the other tribes of the region as ""treacherous and wily and cruel savages"" who were working with foreign governments, particularly the Spanish, to undermine American aims. Putnam analyzed the connotation of Robertson's words to McGillivray, by stating that it was both threatening and complementing at the same time. Putnam also related details of the state of the American government at the time, particularly the shift from the initial loose confederacy of states to the current federalist form of government. He discussed how the initial instability, particularly in the South, of the newly formed United States, desires to settle West, and ongoing conflicts with the Spanish complicated relations with the Native American tribes, specifically the Creeks. Putnam also reported his analysis of McGillivray's character. McGillivray is presented as a cunning, influential man who was after his own interests and who was working with the Spanish to thwart American settlement. To Putnam, Robertson's letter presented McGillivray with a compromise--that his financial and political success would be guaranteed as long as he used his influence to encourage American aims in the frontier. As Putnam noted, two years after Robertson's 1788 letter, a treaty was concluded which established secure Indian land boundaries, ceded a large territory of land to the US, and gave McGillivray the rank of Brigadier General and a salary from the government. Thus, the US government was able to allay the Creek Nation."|Tennessee|Creek Indians -- Treaties|Creek Indians -- Government relations|McGillivray, Alexander|Cherokee Indians -- Violence against|Creek Indians -- Warfare|Letters|    |    |    |http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/|http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/|http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance|http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd|    |Robertson, James|1788-08-03; 1859-00-00|    |Text/html|http://idserver.utk.edu/?id=200300000000736|en|The University of Tennessee Libraries|This work is the property of the Tennessee State Library and Archives, Nashville, Tennessee.

The letter states that the Chickasaws, who were in good relations with the whites, had informed the settlers that the majority of the Creek people wished to be at peace with them. However, the letter refers to several instances that were looked at as being acts of aggression by the Creeks, including the theft of some horses and the loss of white lives. The letter also mentions an instance in which the settlers stumbled upon a deserted Indian camp and retained the horses and other articles from that camp, securing them until it was known to what tribe they belonged.
